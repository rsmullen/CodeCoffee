    "Joblib provides an incredibly easy way to turn a simple for loop into a parallel loop.  This lets you maximize the computing power you have available to you. If you throw this code on your quad-core machine, you'll get a slightly less than 4x speedup.  If you throw this on to an Ocelote interactive node, you'll get about 28x speedup â€” almost for free and with very little coding. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Note that this only works for embarassingly parallel jobs, meaning that individual steps in the loop can't depend on any other step in the loop._\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a bunch of very easy loops, joblib may not be for you. There is overhead associated with creating the parallel jobs, so, to maximize efficiency, make sure that your job execution time is much longer than the overhead. (Typically, if each iteration in a loop takes a few seconds, you'll get a performance increase with joblib). "
